        <p2 style="font-size:24px;">which is a pint of beer with a shot glass full of soju dropped into it, mix that up, and drink whole thing one sip.
        Soju X Beer X Chiken "ChiSoMak"(Makju means beer in korean) is amazing.</p2>

        <br>
        <p2 style="font-size:24px;">SoMakSa is for women's brink I think because that is soft, creamy, and sweet. SoMakSa is good matching with korean pancke. Some people call SoMakSa with pancake "couple" as always together. I love it.
