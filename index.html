         <p11 style="font-size:24px;">Traditional soju is made from a blend of rice and grains. From the 1960s to the 1990s, using rice was banned in Soju production because it was in such short supply, so sojus were made with other starches like sweet potatoes and wheat. Even though the ban is no longer in place, many soju producers look beyond rice for their starches.</p11>
